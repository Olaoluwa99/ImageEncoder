## Overview

In today's digital age, privacy and security are paramount concerns. We often share images that we don't want to be accessible to just anyone. Whether it's personal photos or sensitive documents, ImageEncoder is the app you need to safeguard your visual content. ImageEncoder uses cutting-edge encryption techniques to protect your images by cutting them into grids, shuffling the pieces, and compiling them into a single image.
